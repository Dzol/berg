# Heap

[Heap](http://dzol.github.io/heap) is a Two Pass Minimum Heap for Integers in Elixir.
The underlying library is in Erlang.

## What is it?

Google _Priority Queue_ or _Pairing Heap_ or find them on Wikipedia.
You might be familiar with the heap from **Heap-Sort**, **Dijkstra's**, or **Prim's**.

## Rationale

This is a program w/ which to learn Erlang (but nothing about processes) + how to build an Elixir library around it.
This is a pretty involved Erlang program but its domain isn't complicated.
It involves modules, functions, lists, and tuples.
It's has OTP structure with documentation, type specifications, and a test suite.

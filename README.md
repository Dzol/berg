# Heap

A Minimum Heap for Integers in Erlang.

## What is it?

Google _Priority Queue_ or _Pairing Heap_ or find them on Wikipedia.
You might be familiar with the heap from **Heap-Sort**, **Dijkstra's**, or **Prim's**.

## Documentation

Point a browser at `doc/index.hmtl`.

## Interesting Make Targets

Test with `make` and build the documentaion with `make doc`.

## Exercise:

* Change the data-structure to accomodate arbitrary values.
* Change the data-structure to write a procedure called `weight/1`.
* Write procedures called `listify/1` and `listify/2` (extraction).
* Write a procedure `heapify/1` (insertion).
